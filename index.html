    <p>Dead Horse Caroling, more coloquially known as Mari Lwyd is a Welsh tradition that takes place during Wassailing, which is the act of going door to door on the holiday. The Mari Lwyd is a dead horse's skull affixed onto a large stick or pole, with a white tarp attached to the skull to hide both the person carrying it, and the pole itself. This is often the "leader" of the party, leading others playing instruments, and often dressed in bright colors with painted faces. Once the Mari Lwyd party embarks out to a house, they begin to sing a song to the home owner, and the home owner must give reasons why the party cannot raid their home, if the homeowner runs out of excuses for why they cannot enter, they are obligated to give the Mari Lwyd party food and lots of alcohol.  </p>
